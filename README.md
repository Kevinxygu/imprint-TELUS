1. TELUS' masterbrand rebranding
2. The [TELUS MyPet](https://www.telus.com/en/health/mypet) App

## :book: Learnings

This was my first case competition in around 2 years. I brought my tech background in a really unique way. For the preliminary case, I designed mockups of the TELUS rebrand with Figma. For the final round case I was in charge of ideating, prototyping, then presenting four new features for the TELUS MyPet app:
1. A TELUS AI chat assistant to diagnose vet health conditions and assign next steps based on a repository of known vets.
2. A Figma prototype of a new vet directory to explore, browse, and choose vets to book.
3. A quick book feature for frictionless booking.
4. A map directory showing nearby TELUS MyApp-certified vets.

Here's some things I learned:
| Concept | Learnings |
|:---|:---|
| Case Thinking | This was a very transformative experience where I practiced bridging my tech and business skills together. This kickstarted my interests in consulting, tech consulting, product management and case competitionss! |
| [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/) | I designed several mockups in Figma, and practiced adhering to a branding guideline for the preliminary case. I overhauled TELUS' brand to better showcase its alternative, non-telecommunications business tracks like TELUS Health. I got a lot better at Figma!|
